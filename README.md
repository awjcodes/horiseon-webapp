# <Horiseon Web application>

## Description
For a marketing agency, having a codebase that is difficult to understand and navigate through can become a problem for quality, and work efficiency. So I have decided to improve their codebase so it follows the accessibility standards, and that the site itself is optimized for the search engines. Making the code more easy to navigate around when looking for certain elements within the html, and css code.
